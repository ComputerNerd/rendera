Rendera [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Mortis69/rendera.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Mortis69/rendera)

Rendera is a painting program suitable for photo-retouching and making seamless textures. Originally for Windows, it has been rewritten from scratch using C++/FLTK. Please see the Wiki for a list of features.

Should work on any platform supporting FLTK, (with a possible performance penalty if Xlib is not available). Eventually we should have optimized versions for Win/Mac, but we aren't quite there yet...

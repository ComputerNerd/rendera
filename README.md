Rendera
=======

Rendera is a painting program suitable for photo-retouching and making textures. Originally for Windows, it is being rewritten from scratch using C++/FLTK.

The program is still in development but somewhat usable on Linux. Only a few image formats are supported right now and some menu options don't work yet.

Notes:
At the bottom there are a few buttons:
Wrap: painting will wrap edges.
Clone: enable cloning, with mirror option (Use Shift+Click or Space to change clone target).
Origin: rectangles and circles will start from the corner, or middle.
Constrain: rectangles and circles will stay square.

Wrap and Clone may be combined.

Additional Keys:
Cursor Keys: pan view.
Escape: cancel current tool.

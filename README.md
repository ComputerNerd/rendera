Rendera
=======

Rendera is a painting program suitable for photo-retouching and making textures. Originally for Windows, it is being rewritten from scratch using C++/FLTK.

The program is still in development but somewhat usable on Linux. Only a few image formats are supported right now and some menu options don't work yet. 24-bit PNG/JPEG/BMP/TGA files are supported, and GIMP palettes can be loaded (but not saved yet). No undo yet :(

Keys:
Cursor Keys: pan view.
Shift+Click or Space: move clone target
Escape: cancel current tool.
